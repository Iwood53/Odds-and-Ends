BaseX.py
- Method to convert a base10 number to a base anything.
- can be imported into another python module or used as a command line utility in the following format
- python BaseX.py <base10 to convert from> <baseX to convert to>
- anything above base36 is pretty much useless because a single place can be represented by multiple characters
